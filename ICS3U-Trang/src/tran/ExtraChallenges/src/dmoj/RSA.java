 * A number is an RSA number if it has exactly four divisors. 
 * In other words, there are exactly four numbers that divide 
 * into it evenly. For example, 10 is an RSA number because it
 * has exactly four divisors (1,2,5,10). 12 is not an RSA number
 * because it has too many divisors (1,2,3,4,6,12). 11 is not an
 * RSA number either. There is only one RSA number in the range 10â€¦12.
